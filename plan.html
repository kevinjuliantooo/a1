<h1>Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>This website suppoused to extended this business . they have so many client from all ages (around 30-55) but below. The owner want to make younger audiance intrested with the cosplay because they do not have many younger audiance and sure this would be a big potential for getting high school kids and young adults coplaying. with a webiste, people would be intrested with cosplay and more people would come to the cosplay party also get the costumes made if they knew about CossiePlay.  </p>

<p><strong>Success Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>To measure that the website works and success we can not count from the visitor. we need get the information who many client's income after the website created and look how many people sign-up to CossiePlay.</p>

<p><strong>Target Audiance</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The main target audiance is younger people (high school and young adult)</li>
	<li>I create the simple design (with less information) and put the navigation bar on the top and Call To Action Menu in the middle to make the website look intresting. I also use main color which is purple and white to make the customer always remember about CossiePlay (The dominant color of CossiePlay logo is Purple). So people would not confused when access the website. </li>
</ul>
